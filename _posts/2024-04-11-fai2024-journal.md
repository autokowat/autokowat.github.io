## A review of visual SLAM for robotics: evolution, properties, and future applications

As robotics becomes more integrated into real-world tasks, the need for autonomous mobility fertifies. In the recent years, a variety of V-SLAM techniques have been developed to enhance robot functionality. In our journal we spotlight the most recent advancements in V-SLAM technology and provide guidelines for selecting the most appropriate method for specific robotic projects. We trace the development of SLAM technologies over time, emphasizing fundamental concepts and offering side-by-side comparisons.
