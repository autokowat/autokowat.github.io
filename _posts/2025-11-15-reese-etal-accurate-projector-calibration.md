## Accurate Projector-Camera-Calibration from Structured Light Dot Patterns via Subpixel Plane Reconstruction

We present a method for accurate projector-camera calibration using structured light dot patterns and subpixel plane reconstruction. The approach extracts dense, subpixel-accurate plane observations from dot-pattern captures and uses them to refine the geometric calibration between projector and camera, resulting in improved 3D reconstruction accuracy for structured-light systems.
