## New head pose method presented in IEEE Transaction on Image Processing

In this paper, we introduce a novel method for unconstrained end-to-end head pose estimation, aiming to accurately predict a full range of head orientations beyond the limitations of traditional frontal pose prediction approaches. By employing a continuous 6D rotation matrix representation, our method enables efficient learning of full rotation appearance, enhancing the robustness and efficiency of direct regression. The approach, supported by new accumulated training data and a geodesic loss mechanism, significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy across public datasets.
