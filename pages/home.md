AutoKoWaT (*Innovative Photonics for Autonomous Collaborative Systems in Dynamic Good Transportation Processes*) aims on the development of photonic components, applying sensors and artificial intelligence to self-driving transport systems to solve a wide range of logistics tasks in complex, dynamic situations, either alone or in a swarm. 
The project is funded by the [Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany (BMBF) (grant no.~13N16336)](https://www.photonikforschung.de/projekte/sensorik-und-analytik/projekt/autokowat.html) and is planned with a project duration of 3 years (2022 - 2025).
